          Python AI libraries have one job: To provide the benefits 
          of AI algorithms and tooling without any of the complexities 
          of their implementation. No developer wants to reinvent the 
          wheel or delve into an array of statistics and data science 
          books every time they want to build a chatbot or classify 
          some data. This is where the copious number of AI libraries, 
          written for Python, can make projects faster to build, more 
          readable and more effective at achieving their goals using AI. 
          Read on to find out more.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Python Is Popular for AI Development</h2>
          <p>
          Programming languages come and go. The reason Python has stuck 
          around and become a favorite of most AI developers is primarily 
          due to its simplicity and accessibility. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Due to its interpreted nature, Python can be installed and run on 
          all major platforms. There’s no need for a native compiler to 
          translate instructions; the Python interpreter does all of that 
          for you. It’s also simple to use and understand even for people 
          with non-technical backgrounds. There’s no need for constant 
          semi-colons, long type declarations, or re-inventing common functions.
          </p>
          <p> 
          But perhaps the most important benefit of using Python is its vast 
          ecosystem. There’s a plethora of external libraries that can make 
          your life as a developer easier. Whatever the use case, there will 
          undoubtedly be a Python AI library for it.
          </P>
          <h2>
          A List of Popular AI Libraries
          </h2>
          <h2>
         Machine Learning
          </h2>
          <p>
         Widely considered to be the most popular field of AI today (and often 
         mistakenly thought of as all of AI itself), machine learning allows 
         computer programs to learn on their own. Ordinary programs need to 
         have a human map a specific set of inputs to a specific set of outputs 
         for them. In comparison, machine learning algorithms can learn how to 
         do this through their own experience.
         </p>
         <p>
         This process of learning on their own makes possible a wide variety of 
         applications like building chess bots that can teach themselves how to 
         play chess or fine-tuning recommendation algorithms for videos and content.
         </p> 
        <h3>
        scikit-learn
        </h3>
        <p>
        https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
        </p>
        <p>
        Built using the popular NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib libraries, scikit-learn 
        is a Python AI library that makes implementing machine learning algorithms 
        easier. It has built-in algorithms to classify objects, build regressions, 
        group similar objects into sets (clustering), reduce random variable quantity, 
        preprocessing data and even compare/choose your final model for you. 
        Its extensive library of functionality ensures you don’t have to reinvent 
        the wheel if you want to add machine learning to your project.
        </p>
        <h3>
        TensorFlow
        </h3>
        <p>
        https://tensorflow.org
        </p>
        <p>
        TensorFlow is a framework, created by Google, to make highly complex machine 
        and deep learning algorithms accessible to the masses. Developers build using 
        data-flow graphs where every node (or “neuron”) represents a particular 
        computation as specified by the developer. Then, they can pick one of many 
        already-implemented machine/deep learning algorithms in the TensorFlow library 
        to execute. The computations are written in Python but executed in C++, which 
        is much faster than Python. TensorFlow saves time and increases program speed.
        </p>
        <h3>
        XGBoost
        </h3>
        <p>
        https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/
        </p>
        <p>
        XGBoost stands for extreme gradient boosting. This Python AI library focuses 
        on helping developers classify data and build regressions using boosted 
        decision-tree algorithms. These trees are made up of children of weaker 
        regression models (that represent different computation tasks). As the 
        model is trained, new weaker regression models are added to “fill in the 
        gaps” until no further improvements can be made. By doing this, XGBoost 
        greatly increases scalability and performance; perfect for keeping up 
        with your program’s growth.
        </p>
        <p>
        Matplotlibhttps://matplotlib.org/Matplotlib allows developers to visualize 
        datasets with a variety of different charts. It’s best used to discover 
        and present insights on processed data. Whether it’s by using a static, 
        dynamic or an interactive graph, matplotlib brings your data to life and 
        is important for communication with non-technical audiences.
        </P>
        <h2>
        Natural Language Processing
        </h2>
        <p>
        Natural language processing brings all aspects of linguistics to a 
        computer program. Its ultimate goal is primarily to understand and 
        communicate to humans and other machines. And that’s not as simple 
        as it sounds. There are a lot of rules and hidden information that 
        need to be explicitly taught to machines. To bridge the gap between 
        humans and machines, NLP uses syntactic and semantic analysis to 
        form sentences correctly and extract meaning from them.
        Everything that you communicate with using human language that isn’t 
        a human likely uses some level of NLP. Some examples are chatbots, 
        writing analytics tools (such as Grammarly) and smart assistants 
        in your phones and homes.
        </p>
        <h3>
        NLTK
        </h3>
        <p>
        http://www.nltk.org
        </p>
        <p>
        NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit. It’s a Python AI library 
        that makes trivial linguistics simple through a variety of defined 
        functions and interfaces. From tokenizing and tagging text, to 
        identifying named entities and even displaying parse trees, NLTK 
        is a general-purpose NLP library (or ‘toolkit’) that belongs in 
        any language-based project.

        spaCy
        </h3>
        <p>
        https://spacy.io/
        </p>
        <p>
        spaCy has been described by its developers as “the Ruby on Rails 
        of Natural Language Processing.” Indeed, through its extremely 
        simple API, spaCy makes processing large swathes of text fast 
        and efficient. By providing and integrating tokenizer, tagger, 
        parser, pre-trained word vectors and named entity recognition 
        facilities into one library, spaCy can help your program 
        understand all aspects of a text, or simply pre-process it 
        for one of the other AI libraries to deal with later.

        <h3>
        Gensim
        </h3>
        <p>
        https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/
        </p>
        <p>
        Gensim aims to make the process of identifying the underlying 
        topic of a piece of text (known as topic modeling) substantially 
        easier. It handles the entire modeling process, from processing 
        the text (into a dictionary of tokens) to building the topic model 
        itself all without having to load the entire text into memory.
        </p>
        <h2>
        Neural Networks
        </h2>
        <p>
        Neural networks allow programs to literally use their brains. 
        They use systems of nodes (modeled after the neurons in human 
        brains) with each node representing a particular variable or 
        computation. A particular task (where we need to map an input 
        to a particular output) starts at one input “neuron” (or layer) 
        in the system and can get to the end, processed result (or output) 
        by taking any number of pathways (computations). The pathways that 
        lead to a more successful/closer mapping to the output are 
        strengthened and kept while failing/inaccurate pathways are 
        weakened and discarded. And this is precisely how our brain 
        works. It makes for an incredibly efficient form of learning.
        </p>
        <p>
        Neural networks can allow us to implement facial recognition 
        algorithms, predict the weather more effectively or even simulate 
        marketing campaigns for businesses.

        </p>
        <p>
        Fast Artificial Neural Network Library, or FANN, implements artificial 
        neural networks in C (which is what makes it up to 150 times faster than 
        other libraries) while making them accessible in a number of different 
        languages, including Python. It’s incredibly easy to use, allowing for 
        the creation, training and running of an artificial neural network in 
        just three function calls. With its incredible documentation, 
        comprehensive training framework and parameter versatility, 
        it’s a must-have for a project which employs neural networks.

        <p>
        ffnet is a Python AI library for implementing feed-forward neural 
        networks. It uses a graphical user interface to visualize training 
        datasets. Another strong benefit is its automatic data normalization 
        feature, saving a lot of time in the pre-processing stage of your 
        workflow. Ffnet implements its core functions in Fortran resulting 
        in greatly improved program speed (compared to Python native solutions).

        PyTorch
        </h3>
        <p>
        https://pytorch.org/
        </p>
        <p>
        PyTorch is built for tensor computation tasks (using GPU acceleration) 
        and building more durable deep neural networks on a tape-based autograd 
        system. The last point means that the neural networks PyTorch builds 
        don’t have to be recreated every time the use case changes, thereby 
        improving speed and scalability. Its main use cases lie in replacing 
        NumPy to instead use the power of GPUs (versus CPUs), and as a deep 
        learning research platform that is highly customizable and fast.

        <h2>
        Computer Vision
        </h2>
        <p>
        Like the name suggests, computer vision allows machines to both see 
        and understand what they’re seeing. Through videos and images, machines 
        can figure out what objects they’re looking at and classify them into 
        appropriate categories. That smart CAPTCHA software you see barring 
        you entry to your favorite website is actually getting you to train 
        its computer vision algorithm for it. From facial recognition software
         to autonomous driving systems, computer vision algorithms are 
         everywhere and only growing in complexity.

        <p>
        Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) provides developers with 
        over 2,500 optimized algorithms for a variety of computer vision 
        use cases. From detecting/recognizing faces to classifying human 
        actions, OpenCV makes understanding visual information a simple 
        matter of calling the right function and specifying the right 
        details. Paired with its robust community and extensive 
        documentation, OpenCV is perfect for adding computer vision 
        infrastructure to a project.
        </p>

        <p>
        http://simplecv.org/
        </p>
        <p>
        Where OpenCV focuses on comprehensiveness and customizability, 
        SimpleCV focuses on making computer vision easy. The learning 
        curve is much smaller to the point where getting images from a 
        camera is as simple as initializing a camera (using Camera())
         and getting its image (using Camera.getImage()). This Python 
         AI library is a stellar choice for developers focused on common 
         computer vision applications as opposed to highly customized solutions.

        Expert Systems
        </h3>
        <p>
        Want the advice of an expert? You can ask one (for a price) or you 
        can get a machine to think like an expert for you. As their name 
        suggests, expert systems aim to model an expert’s reasoning process
         using a knowledge base (heaped with relevant data), an inference 
         engine (to reason based on the data), and an explanation interface 
         (to communicate its reasoning to the user).
        So experts such as doctors and engineers can diagnose the type and 
        degree of lung cancer in patients (PXDES) or construct computer systems 
        based on user preferences (R1/XCON).

        <p>
        PyCLIPS provides an inference engine to Python applications. It provides a 
        rules-based engine as binary modules inside the library that are accessed
         using classes and functions. The engine itself stays “alive” in a 
         separate memory space to the Python space, so inferences and rules 
         are persisted as your program grows in functionality.

        Also inspired by CLIPS, Experta is a rule engine that pairs a set 
        of facts with a set of rules based on those facts. Then, actions 
        are executed based on these rules. All facts and rules are held by 
        the implemented knowledge engine which determines the expert output 
        of the system when it is called.

        <p>
        Most artificial intelligence is usually applied to software, not 
        hardware. With robotics, AI meets the physical world through a 
        plethora of different sensors modeling the human senses. From 
        cameras to model sight and radar to model physical touch, AI 
        algorithms must interpret the data from these sensors to allow 
        a machine to function safely and effectively.

        actually needing to possess the physical hardware for it. It uses 
        APIs to hook into your code so it remains language independent. 
        In this way, it provides a sandbox for you to play around with 
        autonomous vehicles without the costs and safety issues you’d 
        need to overcome in the real, physical world.

        flexible vehicle sensors, environmental conditions as well 
        as a wide variety of buildings and vehicles already implemented.

        Bullet provides a physics sandbox where robotics/virtual reality 
        can be created and tested. This allows the development of 
        capital-intense development tasks like collision detection, 
        locomotion skills and reinforcement learning (which requires a 
        lot of failure) to be conducted in a harmless simulation scenario.
