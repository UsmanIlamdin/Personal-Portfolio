        <p>
        Artificial intelligence ( AI) adoption continues to grow and the global AI market is expected to be worth more than $190 billion by 2025. The advantages of AI will continue to thrive as this rising demand continues to flourish.
        </p>
        <p>
       First introduced in the 1950s, in the last sixty-five years AI has changed enormously. While it was initially used in more specialised contexts, such as specialist computer laboratories, usage has increased to the point that AI is incorporated into our daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>
        When AI is part of how we function and how we work, it is crucial that we understand how it is used in our daily lives and how you can affect the industry.
        </p>
        <h2>
        Refresher: What is Artificial Intelligence?
        </h2>
        <p>
        In our article, "What's Artificial Intelligence," we first discussed the concept of artificial intelligence. The main objective of AI is to construct machinery which is capable of displaying intelligent behaviour that is able to think, understand , and act like people. AI can also be summarised with this sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
        AI 's origins include informatics, genetics, psychology, mathematics and engineering. AI creates machine features, including problem solving, learning and reasoning, consistent with human intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
        AI's most important position in healthcare is one of the main advantages. AI provides both diagnosis and care the ability to improve performance and precision.
        </p>
        <p>
        While it can not substitute for doctors, it will significantly boost their preparation and offer useful resources for enhancing their patients ' experiences and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, speaker Andjela Azabagic discussed how risk modelling is based on factors such as family history, genetics and lifestyle in the field of breast cancer research and screening at AI 's Healthcare Virtual Conference.
        </p>
        <p>
        With AI, existing mammogram technology can be exploited to create a risk adaptive screening model that relies more on actual images to predict.
        </p>
        <p>
        Although someone is not considered to be a high risk, the mammograms tell a different storey based on the data they provide.
        </p>
        <p>
        These risk adaptive screening models are capable of identifying risk patients quicker and can then establish a proactive medical plan to actively monitor patients so that any event can be caught, diagnosed and treated faster — increasing the likelihood of a more positive long-term outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
        With everything from the Google Home and Amazon Echo, to the handwriting recognition of the MyScript Nebo application to real-time translation with Skype Translator, AI is becoming more common. Their lives are increasing. 
        </p>
        <h2>
        Benefits of AI
        </h2>
        <p>
        Whether it's at work or at home, AI has a lot to offer. The many advantages of AI are, however, not always obvious to many people. The dangers of AI can easily be seen as more often discussed, but some specific advantages are provided here.
        </p>
        <h3>
        1. Decreased Errors
        </h3>
        <p>
        Human error is an important concern , particularly in healthcare industries. AI can virtually eliminate common errors, known for their accuracy and precisity. In contrast to people who always have the potential to influence outside emotional factors in their decisions, AI works the same each time, regardless of the circumstances. 
        </p>
        <h3>
        2. Better Productivity and Efficiency
        </h3>
        <p>
        There is nothing human in machines — the ability to run around the clock, 365 days per year. People suffer from exhaustion, burnout and stress, but AI technology can consistently be completed without interruption or distraction if a task is performed. While one of AI 's disadvantages is that machines have no feelings, AI can easily manage repeated tasks that require a person to take time, and at a faster rate.
        </p>
        <h3>
        3. Increased Accessibility
        </h3>
        <p>
        When it comes to stuff like space, or exploring certain areas, people simply can't get around. AI's main advantage is that human exploration does not limit its ability to reach remote areas or to extreme temperatures. The sending of important data to a resilient AI machine to accomplish its work. 
        </p>
        <h3>
        4. Simplifying Day-to-Day Life
        </h3>
        <p>
        It is easy to see how AI integrates into our everyday life with estimates of over 3.25 billion people worldwide using digital voice assistants. Smartphones, for example, are highly integrated into AI technology, with GPS-based people, facial recognition and camera inside the phones. In addition, AI has been included in our daily work with social media, streaming of music, drones and video games.
        </p>
        <h3>
        5. Improved Medical Assessments and Outcomes
        </h3>
        <p>
        The healthcare sector is used to classify problems such as neurological disorders or possible carcinogenic threats for many applications in AI. Surgeons can practise with simulators, patients can use AI monitors to capture test data and researchers can review data on potential field treatments easily. With these innovations, AI improves the lives of patients.
        </p>
        <h3>
        How Humans Enhance AI
        </h3>
        <p>
        Yes there are many benefits of AI, however, human capabilities — like moral reasoning — can help enhance the technology.
        </p>
        <p>
        While machines can be built to mimic much of the human condition, they have no emotions. 
        </p>
        <p>
        That means they can’t make any judgements on right or wrong, and don’t have morals or values. 
        </p>
        <p>
        While decisions guided by data can be simpler, decisions based on variables, such as how someone may feel on a certain day, with AI are entirely lost. This makes the AI plus human combination so good.
        </p>
        <p>
        Augmented AI – Matthew Versaggi alluded to during his keynote to the AI Healthcare Virtual Conference – can be a valuable tool in this area to help people decide, rather than to substitute it.
        </p>
        <p>
        This technology is referred to as an improvement in knowledge by a lot of AI developers, and for some people, the purpose of artificial intelligence is to replace human beings entirely – definitely not.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, a doctor performing a surgery is going to sometimes need to make a split second decision when things don’t go according to plan. 
        </p>
        <p>
        But while AI technology will assist in providing complicated equipment for a procedure that has traditionally been more difficult to conduct, the doctor's ability to find a suitable solution can not be substituted at this point in time. The human and AI technologies work together in order to achieve a successful result.
        </p>
        <h2>
        Making an Impact with a Career in AI
        </h2>
        <p>
        If it makes simple homework simpler, better results for medical people or improved procedure performance in the workplace, the advantages of AI affect us personally and professionally.
        </p>
        <p>
        This potential makes AI especially attractive to those who want to start a career in a growing, competitive industry, which has many job opportunities. 
        </p>
