            What does it mean for a machine to learn? In a way, machines 
            learn just like humans. They infer patterns from data through 
            a combination of experience and instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this article, we will give you a sense of the applications
             for machine learning and explain why Python is a perfect choice 
             for getting started.
          </p>
          <p>
          We will discuss concepts central to machine learning and walk you 
          through a simple example of a machine-learning algorithm in Python.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
          <p>
          Machine-learning algorithms are mathematical models that predict 
          something—a category, for example, or a continuous value. To arrive 
          at a prediction, a machine-learning model transforms its input using 
          various parameters that it infers from the data. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the learning part of the process, and it happens iteratively: 
            After seeing the data, the model makes its guess and is then told, by 
            means of a loss function, how far off it was from the desired output.
        </p>
         <p>
            In the next iteration, the model tries to improve its predictions by 
            adjusting its parameters, and after a number of iterations, we can 
            assess our trained model using an evaluation function. If we find 
            that the results are satisfactory,  then the model is ready to make 
            predictions about new, never-before-seen datapoints.
          </p>
          <h2>Why is Python a Good Fit for Machine Learning?</h2>
          <p>
          In recent years Python has become the go-to programming language for 
          machine-learning applications. It stands out for its readability — it’s 
          easy to learn, making it accessible even to programming newbies — and 
          its portability, since it runs on all operating systems.
          </p>
        <p>
        But Python‘s main selling point as the machine-learning framework of choice 
        is its vast ecosystem. Most machine-learning algorithms are implemented 
        directly in Python. What’s more, the community actively provides support 
        to its own members on question-and-answer platforms like StackOverflow.
        </p>
        <p>
        This means that for virtually any problem you’re likely to encounter 
        in the beginning, you can find a solution online. Check out our 
        Introduction to Python online class to get started with this powerful language.
          </p>
          <h2>Some Core Concepts of Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>
          In this section, we cover some basic concepts that provide useful context 
          when diving into machine learning with Python.
          </p>
          <h3>Supervised vs. Unsupervised</h3>
          <p>
          Even the most sophisticated model is useless if you lack the data to train it. 
          In a supervised problem, the data must be labeled: During training, you provide 
          a target variable for every datapoint. Labeled data is expensive because it 
          usually requires humans to do the labeling. In contrast, unsupervised algorithms 
          can handle unlabeled data.
        </p>
        <p>
        They are designed to discern underlying regularities in the input on their own. 
        Finally, reinforcement learning lies somewhere between supervised and unsupervised 
        learning.
        </p>
        <p>
        As in supervised learning, the goal is specified in advance, but the model 
        devises a strategy to reach it and maximize its reward in a relatively unsupervised 
        fashion. Reinforcement strategies are often used to teach computers to play games.
        </p>
          <h3>Classification vs. Regression</h3>
        <p>
            If we use a machine-learning application to predict categories (say, images of 
            ducks vs. images of geese), we’re solving a classification problem. Classifiers 
            are not confined to binary problems; they work with multiclass distinctions, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, we use regression models to predict continuous values like 
            house prices. Under the hood, both classification and regression algorithms work 
            with continuous values, but in a classification algorithm they’re used to 
            determine class probabilities. 
        </p>

          
          <h3>BOverfitting vs. Underfitting</h3>
          <p>
            To understand the concepts of over- and underfitting, we need to acquaint 
            ourselves with the notions of bias and variance. Bias describes the rigidity 
            of the model, while variance refers to its volatility. A model with too high 
            a bias can’t effectively learn from the data, leading to an underfit model.
          </p>
          <p>
            An overfit model, on the other hand, has a high variance and is overly tuned 
            to the training data. When seeing new data, an overfit model typically performs
             very poorly, because it has not learned the right level of abstraction from 
             its input. When designing a model, we want to balance the effects of both 
             phenomena. This is known as the bias-variance tradeoff.
          </p>
          <h3>Examples of Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
          <p>
          Here are a few examples of specific tasks that machine learning in Python can 
          be used for.
          </p>
          <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
            <p>
            The logistic regression algorithm is based on a centuries-old statistical 
            technique and is used for simple binary classifications. It also deserves 
            an award for the machine-learning technique with the most misleading name, 
            since it describes not a regression but a classification. 
            </p>
         <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
        <p>
        In its most basic form, a decision-tree model learns to split data along 
        features iteratively in order to arrive at a class prediction. More 
        sophisticated tree-based algorithms combine hundreds of trees to achieve 
        accurate predictions. This is known as ensemble learning.
        </p>
        <h3>k-means Clustering</h3>
        <p>
        A clustering algorithm is an example of unsupervised learning in action. 
        It iteratively assigns unlabeled input data to a number of groups (clusters)
         and tries to maximize homogeneity within each cluster as well as distinctiveness 
         among clusters. Before running the algorithm, the user must define the number 
         of groups (specified by the hyperparameter k).
        </p>
        <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>
        In deep learning, data is run through complex graph-based models called 
        neural networks. These days, the best models for tasks involving unstructured 
        data (such as pictures or natural language) are based on neural networks. 
        Training an algorithm like this requires lots of data and computing resources 
        capable of doing millions of computations in parallel (such as GPUs).
        </p>
        <h3>A Python Machine-Learning Example</h3>
        <p>
            In this example, we’ll use a random forest classifier (an ensemble 
            method based on decision trees) to predict wine types. Our feature 
            vectors consist of values for 13 chemical attributes (such as alcohol 
            content or acidity), while the output value is one of three different 
            classes representing the type of grape.
        </p>  
         <img src="./images/mlexample.jpg">
        <p>
        Confusion matrices, also known as error matrices, are handy devices for 
        assessing the performance of a classifier. The x-axis shows the actual label, 
        and the y-axis shows the predicted one. The numbers on the diagonal indicate 
        which samples were classified correctly. As we see above on the middle line of 
        results, one member each of the first and third classes were incorrectly grouped 
        into the second class. This gives us an accuracy (the percentage of correctly 
        classified samples) of 96 percent. Finally, we printed the three top features
         used by the model as predictors for classifying the samples.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now that we’ve walked through a simple example of machine learning in Python, 
        let’s have a look at a few popular Python frameworks for machine learning.
        </p>
        <h2>Python Machine-Learning Frameworks</h2>
        <h3>scikit-learn</h3>
        <p>
        You might have noticed that all the functions we used in our wine classification 
        example came from the same library. In fact, when doing machine learning 
        with Python, there is almost no avoiding scikit-learn, commonly abbreviated 
        as sklearn. The framework comes with implementations of the most popular 
        machine-learning algorithms, as well as plenty of helper functions.
        </p>
        <h3>TensorFlow</h3>
        <p>
        Google’s deep learning library TensorFlow has quickly become the most popular 
        framework for building neural nets. The latest update integrates the modular 
        interface Keras as a high-level API, making it more accessible for beginners. 
        </p>
        <h3>Matplotlib</h3>
        <p>
        A graph says more than a thousand code snippets. Humans are highly visual, 
        and plotting the results of your model, or a feature distribution from your 
        dataset, will gain you new insights. Matplotlib, Python’s default plotting 
        library, provides templates for all kinds of graphs and has great customizability.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        While often used as a buzzword, the term “machine learning” is shorthand 
        for an entire world of models and applications. In this article, we provided 
        an overview over its most common concepts. In order to get an understanding of 
        machine learning in practice, we suggest you choose a problem that interests you, 
        and then you can start working on your own machine learning projects in Python.
