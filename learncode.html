          Learning how to code is an extremely useful skill to have 
          in your repertoire. Whether you want to build a prototype 
          for your great app idea or snag that promotion you’ve had 
          your eye on at work, coding skills can get you there.
          </p>
          <p>
          What’s more, Monster projected that jobs requiring skills 
          in programming will rise by over 8% in the next 10 years. 
          In fact, Uber, Google, Intel, and other large companies 
          are consistently looking for professionals with coding 
          skills.
          </p>
          <p>
          While learning to code may sound intimidating, it’s not only 
          attainable and necessary. The new world of work will increasingly 
          need coders. And, with these skills, you’ll be able to work in a 
          wide variety of industries building solutions that help to analyze 
          data, cut down manual labor, and even educate and entertain.
          </p>
          <p>
          To get you from staring at a blank computer screen to becoming the 
          next expert coder, you need to know where to start. There are 
          several techniques first-time programmers can use to learn how 
          to code, ranging from reading coding textbooks to online courses. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The way(s) you choose to learn to code depends entirely on your 
          future goals. However, everyone has to start somewhere. Here are 
          the top three most effective ways to begin learning how to code.
          </p>
          <h2>1. Explore Literary Options and Research Guides</h2>
          <p>Learning to code from a book instead of a computer might seem a 
          little old school, but it is an effective method. </p>
          <p>Books on coding are great because they contain a combination of 
          high-level and deep information on a particular coding language. 
          They also have practice problems that start at the basics and build 
          up into more advanced learning.</p>
          <p>Spend some time researching online about what language you wish 
          to learn, then go see what is available at your local bookstore or 
          online. A few popular options include Code Simplicity: The Fundamentals 
          Of Software, The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery, and 
          Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction. </p>
          <h2>2. Try the Self-taught Route and Build Something New </h2>
          <p>There’s no better way to learn than by doing, right? Dive right into
           learning to code by forming a group project with friends who either 
           know how already or are interested in learning. Alternatively, 
           you could contribute to an open-source project on GitHub. </p>
           <p>If you choose this route, be sure that you are comfortable with 
           making mistakes. Failure is a normal part of the learning process. </P>
           <p>Try to leverage the people you are working with by asking more 
           experienced coders for code reviews, and be sure to ask them to be 
           brutal with their comments so you can learn! </p>
          <h2>3. Learn to Code Online</h2>
          <p>Online learning platforms — like Coursera — offer robust, yet manageable, 
          coursework to help you achieve your technical learning goals, like learning 
          how to code.</p>

          <p>Online courses generally are led by teachers from the industry, consist 
          of projects for deeper understanding, and provide a community of students 
          to interact with as you learn to code. Plus, Udacity has free courses like 
          Intro to Algorithms and Programming Languages to help you get acquainted 
          with coding before you dive into the world of programming.</p>
          <p>The best part? You can learn to code on your own time and from anywhere.</P>

          <h2>Ready to Learn an In-demand Skill?</h2>
          <p>Learning to code can help you build up your technical skills and advance 
          your goals. If you’re dying to get started right away, pick up a book, start 
          a coding project.</p>
