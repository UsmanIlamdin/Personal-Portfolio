            Viewing a YouTube tutorial on Python or 
            browsing through the official documentation
            isn’t necessarily be the best way to learn
            Python. Without a reliable mentor in the 
            programming community, it becomes incredibly 
            difficult to quickly and efficiently learn new 
            languages, primarily because students don’t know 
            what they don’t know. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The hours spent searching for the content students 
            need, taught well by the right teacher in the right 
            context, would be better spent actually learning the 
            language and preparing to apply it in the real world. 
            And some ways of learning Python (or any language, for 
            that matter) are much better than others. Read on to 
            find out more.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Learn Python?</h2>
          <p>
          More than ever, today’s world is driven by software. 
          Programming will remain an essential skill to learn 
          in the future, regardless of chosen industry. Of all 
          the programming languages in circulation today, Python 
          stands out as one of the most versatile and easy to use,
          as we explain below. 
          </p>
          <h2>Python is Beginner-Friendly</h2>
          <p>The Python programming language is readable and its 
          syntax forgiving, making it friendly to developers of all 
          skill levels. Its cross-platform nature means it can run 
          on any machine. Furthermore, Python is built with modern 
          design paradigms like object-oriented programming in mind. 
          Its compatibility with software architectural best practices 
          means beginners will save time and effort starting off with 
          a language ready for modern development. By building these 
          design constructs into the language, using Python avoids 
          training bad habits and practices early in your development 
          career and onward.
          </p>
          <h2>Python Has a Strong Ecosystem</h2>
          <p>In addition to the benefits of the language’s design, 
          Python has a massive ecosystem. Its vast community has created 
          packages and open-source libraries for nearly every imaginable 
          use case. No matter the project you’re working on, chances are 
          that at least some parts of that project already exist in Python’s 
          ecosystem of libraries.This ecosystem includes libraries that specialize 
          in modern, active disciplines like automation, research and data science. 
          Libraries such as NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib can provide vital 
          assistance in a data scientist’s workflow. They can add powerful 
          mathematical capabilities, data visualization tools and data 
          preparation operations to Python, making data science research 
          and development a breeze.
          </p>
          <h2>Python is a Popular Choice for AI</h2>
          <p>The same applies to the development of artificial intelligence, 
          without a doubt a hot topic these days. Check out our article 
          dedicated to Popular Python AI Libraries for more information. 
          Python now provides native support for numerous applications 
          from machine learning to expert systems and natural language 
          processing, so AI developers need look no further than Python 
          to find the resources they need for their projects.</p>
          <h2>Use Python for General Automation</h2>
          <p>Alongside Python’s tremendous research capabilities, it 
          can also add value to commercial endeavors with its robust 
          automation. You can automate almost anything using Python, 
          from sending emails to creating invoices and scripts to automatically 
          scraping data from websites (check out Automate the Boring Stuff with 
          Python for more use cases). With most of the automation legwork completed 
          for you in the form of libraries available in the Python ecosystem, a 
          simple package installation is all it takes for automation to start 
          making your business more profitable and easier to run.</p>

          <p>All that’s left for you to do is to dive in and learn Python.</p>
          <h2>Best Ways to Learn Python</h2>
          <h3>1.  Contribute to Open-Source Projects</h3>
          <p>Learning by building projects is one of the best ways to absorb 
          knowledge that can’t be explicitly taught. If you’re not ready to 
          develop your own projects, open-source projects allow you to contribute 
          to real-world applications without having to come up with the original 
          concept yourself. Participation and a penchant for learning are all that’s 
          required to learn Python this way.</p>

          <p>There’s a multitude of resources that can help developers discover new 
          open-source projects open to contributors. Sites like First Timers Only 
          provide comprehensive, multi-step guides that help new developers find not 
          only projects that accept contributions but also healthy projects to contribute 
          to — for example, ones with published codes of conduct. Up For Grabs also offers 
          a search engine for projects actively seeking new contributors.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the most comprehensive solution for connecting developers with 
          open-source projects is CodeTriage. The site works by picking a set of issues 
          affecting some open-source projects, then notifying and assigning developers 
          to them based on repositories they selected. It saves developers time hunting 
          for projects and gives them the ability to effect meaningful change.</p>
          <h3>2. Go Through a Python Tutorial</h3>
          <p>For those still working up the confidence to get building straight 
          away, taking a Python tutorial can provide the right learning environment 
          to bootstrap your development skills. A guided tutorial saves you having to 
          hunt for the right resources and content that can teach you what you need to 
          know. The end result is a deeper and more durable comprehension of Python, 
          as opposed to the shallow understanding that will inevitably result from quick 
          Google searches and browsing Stack Overflow.
          </p>
          <p>Typical curricula involve first learning the basics of Python and its 
          syntax and then going over specific features of the language, for use cases 
          in data science or web development. You can expect to learn about native Python 
          data types (like lists and dictionaries) and some popular Python libraries 
          applicable to your specific use case. All of this takes place in a controlled 
          environment focused on absorbing concepts rather than the potentially overwhelming 
          nature of a real-world project.</p>
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>Learning a programming language is one of the best ways to boost your career 
          prospects and get ready for the modern job market. Among all programming languages, 
          it’s clear that Python ranks as one of the most friendly for new students. 
          To learn Python, developers can delve into the world of open-source projects to 
          learn by application or take one of the widely available Python tutorials that 
          direct them step-by-step through the nuances of learning this programming 
          language. </p>
